# CLI Enhancement Orchestration Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive deep research analysis of four key areas, this
orchestration plan outlines the implementation of critical CLI enhancements for
the khive development workflow. The primary focus is on creating a robust
`khive ci` command from scratch and enhancing the existing `khive fmt` command
with iterative auto-fixing capabilities and approval stamp mechanisms.

### 1.1 Key Research Findings

The deep research revealed:

1. **No existing `khive ci` command** - Must be built from scratch
2. **Current `khive fmt` exists** but needs enhancement for iterative
   auto-fixing
3. **Critical need for approval stamp mechanisms** for local CI validation
4. **Performance and reliability patterns** from modern CLI tools
5. **Intelligent context-aware CLI patterns** for enhanced developer experience

### 1.2 Strategic Objectives

- Implement robust local CI checks that mirror remote CI pipeline
- Enable iterative auto-fixing with loop detection and convergence algorithms
- Create persistent "stamp of approval" mechanisms for workflow validation
- Enhance developer experience through intelligent CLI patterns
- Ensure performance optimization and reliability

## 2. Analysis of Current State

### 2.1 Existing CLI Commands

**Current khive CLI structure:**

- [`khive clean`](src/khive/cli/khive_clean.py:1) - Branch cleanup functionality
- [`khive commit`](src/khive/cli/khive_commit.py:1) - Enhanced git commit with
  conventional commits
- [`khive fmt`](src/khive/cli/khive_fmt.py:1) - Multi-stack formatting (needs
  enhancement)
- [`khive info`](src/khive/cli/khive_info.py:1) - Information service
  integration

## 6. Technical Implementation Strategy

### 6.1 `khive ci` Implementation Approach

**Architecture Pattern**: Following the existing CLI pattern in
[`khive_fmt.py`](src/khive/cli/khive_fmt.py:1)

**Key Components**:

1. **CLI Entry Point**: `src/khive/cli/khive_ci.py`
2. **Command Implementation**: `src/khive/commands/ci.py`
3. **Configuration**: `.khive/ci.toml` support
4. **State Management**: `.khive/.ci_success_stamp` file

**Implementation Strategy**:

```python
# Pseudocode structure based on research findings
class CIConfig:
    max_iterations: int = 3
    stamp_file_path: Path = Path(".khive/.ci_success_stamp")
    enable_loop_detection: bool = True
    performance_caching: bool = True

async def run_iterative_precommit(config: CIConfig) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Implement iterative pre-commit with loop detection"""
    file_hashes = {}
    for iteration in range(config.max_iterations):
        # Run pre-commit
        result = await run_precommit()

        # Check for convergence
        current_hashes = get_file_hashes()
        if detect_loop(file_hashes, current_hashes):
            break

        file_hashes[iteration] = current_hashes

    # Create approval stamp
    create_approval_stamp(config)
```

### 6.2 Enhanced `khive fmt` Integration

**Modification Strategy**: Extend existing
[`format_stack`](src/khive/cli/khive_fmt.py:356) function

**Key Enhancements**:

- Integration with iterative execution loop
- Enhanced conflict detection between formatters
- Performance optimization for repeated runs
- Better error reporting and recovery

### 6.3 Approval Stamp Mechanism

**File Structure**:

```json
{
  "khiveCiVersion": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-22T13:42:00Z",
  "precommitConfigHash": "sha256:abc123...",
  "status": "success",
  "approvedFiles": [
    {
      "path": "src/main.py",
      "hash": "sha1:def456..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Validation Logic**: Integrate into
[`khive commit`](src/khive/cli/khive_commit.py:1) and
[`khive pr`](src/khive/cli/khive_pr.py:1)
