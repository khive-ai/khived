## 1. Research Topic

Advanced Git Workflow Integration Patterns for Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Tools.

## 2. Project Context: khive.d

The `khive.d` project aims to build a comprehensive, intelligent, and efficient
CLI-centric development environment. A core part of this is robust integration
with Git workflows to automate, validate, and streamline developer operations.
We are currently enhancing our `khive` CLI, with a focus on local CI/CD
capabilities (`khive ci`), automated formatting (`khive fmt`), and intelligent
developer assistance.

This research will inform the design and implementation of these advanced Git
integration features.

## 3. Orchestration Plan Reference

This research request is a direct outcome of the **CLI Enhancement Orchestration
Plan**, specifically section `3.3.1`. The plan can be found at:
[`IP-cli_enhancement_orchestration_plan.md`](.khive/reports/ip/IP-cli_enhancement_orchestration_plan.md:1).

## 4. Existing Foundational Research

We have already conducted initial deep research that touches upon some aspects
of CLI and workflow automation. These documents provide foundational context:

- **Designing robust local CI checks for development workflows**: Covers
  pre-commit auto-fixing, loop detection, and performance.
  ([`.khive/deep_research/001_Designing_robust_local_CI_checks_for_development_workflows.md`](.khive/deep_research/001_Designing_robust_local_CI_checks_for_development_workflows.md:1))
- **Enhancing `khive ci`: Auto-Fix Iterations & Approval Stamp**: Details
  iterative pre-commit and local approval mechanisms.
  ([`.khive/deep_research/002_Enhancing_khive_ci_Auto_Fix_Iterations_Approval_Stamp.md`](.khive/deep_research/002_Enhancing_khive_ci_Auto_Fix_Iterations_Approval_Stamp.md:1))
- **Strategies for Iterative Auto-Fixing and Local State Persistence**: Focuses
  on loop detection with content hashing and stamp validation.
  ([`.khive/deep_research/003_Strategies_for_Iterative_Auto_Fixing_and_Local_State_Persistence.md`](.khive/deep_research/003_Strategies_for_Iterative_Auto_Fixing_and_Local_State_Persistence.md:1))
- **Building Intelligent, Context-Aware CLI Systems**: Explores modern CLI
  architectures, event-driven systems, and AI augmentation.
  ([`.khive/deep_research/004_Building_Intelligent_Context_Aware_CLI_Systems_for_Khive_Development_Workflow.md`](.khive/deep_research/004_Building_Intelligent_Context_Aware_CLI_Systems_for_Khive_Development_Workflow.md:1))

This new research should build upon these existing insights, focusing
specifically on advanced Git integration.

## 5. Research Scope & Key Questions

The research should cover, but not be limited to, the following areas:

### 5.1. Git Hooks Management and Automation

- **Best practices for managing complex Git hook setups** across a team/project
  (e.g., tools like Husky, Lefthook, or custom solutions).
- Strategies for **dynamic or conditional hook execution** based on context
  (branch, changed files, etc.).
- Ensuring **cross-platform compatibility and performance** of Git hooks.
- How can CLI tools reliably install, update, and manage Git hooks without
  interfering with user's existing global/local hooks?

### 5.2. Branch-Aware CI Validation Strategies

- Techniques for implementing **different sets or intensities of CI checks**
  based on the current Git branch (e.g., lightweight checks on feature branches,
  comprehensive checks on `main`/`develop`, release branches).
- How can a CLI tool effectively **detect the current branch context** and apply
  appropriate validation rules?
- Patterns for **integrating branch-specific rules with a centralized CI
  configuration**.

### 5.3. Merge Conflict Resolution in Automated Workflows

- Strategies for CLI tools to **detect and handle potential merge conflicts**
  _before_ an actual `git merge` or `git rebase` operation is attempted by the
  user (e.g., during a `khive pr` or `khive ci --on-target-branch` simulation).
- Can CLI tools **assist in or partially automate the resolution of common merge
  conflicts**, especially those arising from automated formatting or
  refactoring?
- Best practices for **safely aborting or rolling back automated actions** when
  unresolvable merge conflicts are predicted or encountered.

### 5.4. Git Notes vs. Alternative Metadata Storage

- A **deep comparative analysis** of using `git notes` versus other methods
  (e.g., local files in `.git` or `.khive`, commit message trailers, dedicated
  metadata files versioned in the repo) for storing CLI-related metadata (like
  CI approval stamps, review status, tool-specific state).
- **Pros and cons** of each approach regarding:
  - Discoverability and accessibility by CLI tools and developers.
  - Persistence, history, and auditability.
  - Impact on repository size and performance.
  - Ease of sharing across team members (synchronization).
  - Potential for conflicts and resolution strategies.
  - Security implications.
- **Real-world examples** of how popular development tools store such metadata.

## 6. Expected Deliverables

1. **Comprehensive Research Report (`RR-GitWorkflowIntegration.md`)**:
   - A detailed document summarizing findings for each research area.
   - Analysis of existing tools and best practices in the industry.
   - Actionable recommendations tailored for the `khive` CLI project.
   - Pros and cons of different approaches.
   - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies for `khive`.
   - References to relevant articles, tools, and documentation.
2. **Presentation of Findings**: A summary presentation to the `khive` team.

## 7. Timeline

A preliminary estimate for this research is **1-2 weeks**.
